PART 1:
In order to make any serial work with any name;
replace command at 00401241
	- CMP EAX,EBX
with new command
	- CMP EAX, EAX
(line 158 in file 'pt1_binary')

This will bypass the check for serial number versus transformed name by always checking EAX against EAX, and so always passing the check



PART 2:
How to obtain correct serial for any name:
	- open CrackMe in OllyDbg
	- create breakpoint at location 00401243
	- Run CrackMe, enter in name
	- go to EAX register, obtain value in that register
	- restart CrackMe and use that value instead of the desired name
	- the value in the EBX register is the serial value for that name
